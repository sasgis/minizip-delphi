Delphi wrapper for [minizip](https://github.com/nmoinvaz/minizip) C library.

Tested with Delphi 2007 and Delphi 10.3 Rio. 

`test` folder contains simple zip read/write program, use it as a simple usage example.

`lib` folder contains scripts to build libminizip.dll from GitHub sources ([here](https://bintray.com/zed/generic/libminizip) is my compiled binaries).
